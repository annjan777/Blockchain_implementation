Hey there,

I'm sending you a project that's all about building a system where computers (called miners) work together to keep track of transactions, like who's sending what to whom. It's like having a shared digital notebook where everyone writes down what's happening.

Project Structure:
Here's how the project is organized:

blockchain_implementation/: This folder contains all the project files.

app.py: This is the main Flask application file. It sets up the server to handle incoming requests, manage miners, and distribute transactions.

blockchain.py: This file contains the logic for creating and managing the blockchain, including adding blocks and ensuring their validity.

distributor.py: Here, we have the distributor class, which manages communication between miners and handles transaction distribution.

miner.py: This file defines the Miner class, which represents each miner in the network. Miners listen for incoming transactions and mine new blocks.

transaction.py: This file defines the Transaction class, which represents individual transactions in the blockchain.

manager.py: This file contains the MinerManager class, which manages the addition and removal of miners and facilitates communication between them.

templates/: This folder contains HTML templates for rendering web pages.

static/: Here, you'll find static assets like CSS and JavaScript files.

README.md: This file contains instructions and information about the project.

How to Run:
Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the Flask App: Run the following command to start the Flask server:

Copy code
python3 app.py
Add Miners: You'll need to add miners to the network. Use the following command to add a miner:

json
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"host": "<miner_host>", "port": <miner_port>, "miner_address": "<miner_name>"}' http://<server_ip>:5000/add_miner
Replace <miner_host>, <miner_port>, and <miner_name> with the host address, port, and name of your miner, respectively. Also, replace <server_ip> with the IP address of the machine running the Flask server.

Submit a Transaction: To submit a transaction, use the following command:

json
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sender": "<sender_name>", "recipient": "<recipient_name>", "amount": <transaction_amount>}' http://<server_ip>:5000/transaction
Replace <sender_name>, <recipient_name>, and <transaction_amount> with the relevant details.

Check the Blockchain: You can check the current state of the blockchain by sending a GET request to:

arduino
Copy code
http://<server_ip>:5000/chain
List Miners: To see the list of miners currently in the network, use:

arduino
Copy code
http://<server_ip>:5000/miners
Remove a Miner: If you need to remove a miner from the network, you can do so with:

json
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"miner_address": "<miner_name>"}' http://<server_ip>:5000/remove_miner
Additional Notes:
Make sure to replace placeholders like <server_ip>, <miner_host>, <miner_port>, <miner_name>, <sender_name>, <recipient_name>, and <transaction_amount> with actual values.

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to reach out!

Happy coding! Let me know if you have any questions.
